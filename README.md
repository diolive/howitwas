# HowItWas
HowItWas is a simple anonymous feedback tracker.
There is *no way* to recognize who _exactly_ leave the individual feedback.

## What we store for every Feedback Request aka Poll:
* Total list of participators (they should to leave a feedback)
* List of those who doesn't leave a feedback yet
* List of non personalized feedbacks

## What we *don't* store:
* Link between user and feedback

## Effects:
* You couldn't know who left the invidual feedback.
* Every participator can leave the feedback only once (beware of flooding).
* If your feedback was deleted you won't get back the right to post it again.
