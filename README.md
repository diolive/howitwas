# HowItWas
HowItWas is a simple anonymous feedback tracker.
There is *no way* to recognize who _exactly_ leave the individual feedback.

## What we store for every Feedback Request aka Survey:
* Total list of participators (might to leave a feedback)
* List of those who leave a feedback already
* List of non personalized feedbacks

## What we *don't* store:
* Relations between users and feedbacks

## Effects:
* You couldn't know who left the invidual feedback.
* Every participator can leave the feedback only once (beware of flooding).
* There is no opportunity to rewrite or remove your pesonal feedback. Just because it will no be a personal.
* If your feedback was deleted by administratot you won't get back the right to post it again.
